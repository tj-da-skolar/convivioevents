			<br><p><font size="5%;">Everything started in September 2014, when a female Computer Science student from De La Salle University - Manila realized the difficulty of planning for a grand celebration, such as 18th birthday debut, based from her own experience with the process of organizing an event for her special day way back. <br><br>She started to form a group composed of students with same course and university as her that would make her idea happen.</font></p>
